# SOC 2025: Algorithmic Trading in Python

This is the backtester you will be using to analyze the performance of your strategies. We will update this repository time to time so make sure you set it as upstream and keep fetching updates. 
If you're unsure about using GitHub or Git please watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA5TTz6BXhY&ab_channel=TraversyMedia). 

## How to Run

Ensure you have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) downloaded.

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository. This will set `origin` to this repository automatically. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dhruv-x7x/AlgoTradingBacktester.git
```

#### Step 2: cd into it
```bash
cd AlgoTradingBacktester
```

#### Step 3: Set up Virtual Environment (Optional: You may use your global environments)
```bash
python -m venv ./venv
```
Activate the venv
```bash
./venv/Scripts/activate
# or source ./venv/bin/activate for Linux/macOS users
```

#### Step 4: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 5: Run the GUI
```bash
python GUI.py
```

## Instructions to Run a Backtest

There are three sections on the GUI, 
- Data Files
- Status & Logs
- Interactive Results

#### Data Files

- **Load Price Data**: Clicking this will open your file explorer. Navigate to wherever you cloned AlgoTradingBacktester and you should find `/data/prices.csv`
- **Load Trades Data**: Same as above but the file is called `/data/trades.csv`
- **Load Strategy**: Same as above but the file is called `Strategy.py`. Make your changes in this file and upload it to the backtester.
- **Run Backtest**: Self-explanatory

#### Status & Logs
Will display any errors you might encounter during the backtesting. You may also find errors in the terminal. If you can't figure it out then ask a mentor.

#### Interactive Results

- **Open Interactive Dashboard**: Opens a HTML webpage generated by the GUI which displays PnL chart and Position chart. Disabled if you haven't run a backtest yet.
- **Performance Summary**: Self-explanatory. If it doesn't work, try again.
- **Export Results**: Saves a csv file of your PnL.

DM any mentor if you encounter an error, or post in the WA group chat.
